# Chicago Traffic Crashes Analysis

This study creates machine learning models to predict the seriousness of car crashes using 2019 and 2020 crash reports from the publicly accessable database maintained by the Chicago Police Department. A car crash is considered serious if the crash results in an injury or the car is towed due to the crash. Models use categorical features that describe conditions at the time of the crash and crash causes to predict the required target. The current focus is to classify whether a crash results in an injury. All machine learning models are trained, validated, and tested on randomly split 2019 crash reports. The best model (along with all others) are then tested using the full set of 2020 crash reports.


## Data Source

The notebooks' sequence starts with the direct raw download of data from the **Chicago data portal** in notebook **01_cleaning**, subsequent notebooks read from the output file created in the cleaning notebook **crash_df.parquet** and might apply further steps after that.


We work with a snapshot downloaded on 2021-02-28, but the whole process is expected to be re-executable without any issues as in later stages we filter down the working data to include the years of 2018, 2019, and 2020, which are all in the past, so we do not expect them to change.

Also, we write out the data into Parquet format to read and write the massive amount of data faster.

We kept the online download code commented to prevent slowing down the process once we have the local copies downloaded.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The data used for the study is maintained by the City of Chicago at the Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/ .  
  
We apply modeling on counts of traffic crashes per location based on a large set of features:  
(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if ).  
  
The dataset is updated daily with new crash reports provided by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash). Data is limited to crashes for which the Chicago Police Department is the responding police agency. Thus, reports are not provided for crashes on the interstate highways that go through Chicago. While data starts in 2015 for some police districts, citywide crash data begins in September 2017. We decided to limit data analysis to 2018-2020 reports as these reports are complete and cover both pre-covid and covid traffic crashes.

Modeling is done on 2019 data and tested on 2020 data.

**Total records downloaded (2018~2020):**  
* 328,790 records

**Total records used (2019-2020):**

**Target Features (2019 ratio):**  
* has_injuries (0.14)

(*) starred features were not all used during the analysis, they were experimented with on and off
    
    
After cleaning is performed in **01_cleaning**, EDA is applied in two steps. The first step is to generate an overview of the whole data to undertstand the data distributions per feature. Also, to find obvious relations and patterns using correlations. This part is auto generated using SweetViz after performing the data cleaning step to generate a consolidated overview report. The report can be found in **02_report_sweetviz**.  

The second step of the EDA is more focused and in depth. A set of tabulations, aggregations, and detailed visualizations are created to uncover any possible latent information that is not revealed in the first general step of EDA. The outcomes can be found in **03_analysis_m**.
